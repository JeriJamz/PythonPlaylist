Notes for the Py Ai Doc#*ima blow throw jus bc
Ai is structured after the human brain bc were not the creative
its onna grid
gonna need to be good at googling math and making a math calculator 
and yea so actully code stuff*#

Binarization:
this is how things are made into 1\0(the on off\switch)
mean removal:
people like to remove the mean from vectors:
    so each feature is center on the 0(false)#calling this a zero feels like a sin
